In contrast, in oogenesis, the differentiation of the oocyte into a mature egg occurs before the completion of meiosis.\\n\\n(c) Meiosis occurs continuously in a mitotically dividing stem cell population: In spermatogenesis, meiosis occurs continuously in a mitotically dividing stem cell population. This means that new spermatogonia are constantly being produced, which can then enter meiosis to produce sperm. In oogenesis, however, meiosis is initiated in a finite number of oogonia, and once these oogonia have entered meiosis, they do not divide mitotically.\\n\\n(e) It is initiated at puberty: Spermatogenesis is initiated at puberty due to the increased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH acts on the Leydig cells to stimulate the production of testosterone, which is necessary for spermatogenesis.
